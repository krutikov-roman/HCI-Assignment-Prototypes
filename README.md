# ðŸ“± Sheridan Courses App (HCI Assignment 2 + 3)

A Figma prototype for a simple mobile app for interacting with Sheridan Courses.

It allows a user to log in and see their Course List. From there, within each course there is:

* The main page with Announcements and Course Content
* Navigation back to the Course List
* A separate "Assignments" Screen
* A separate "View Grades" Screen 
* A separate "Group Chats" Screen
  * Multiple group chats can exist for each course

Once a user is finished, they can log out from the app from any page by clicking the "Account" button in the top right and then clicking "Sign Out"

## âœ… Five New Desirable Functionalities Not Seen In Other Course Apps

1. A feature that lets students to take pictures and scan in their written work into a pdf within the course app, rather than having to use a separate app to take the picture and convert it to a pdf.
2. A feature that automatically generates practice problems based on lecture notes/course content.
3. A feature that lets students submit their completed practice problems, and if they got them right then they are put onto a list that other students can see. This gives a social incentive for students to do practice problems, and lets those who are struggling with problems know who they can ask for help.
4. A functionality that live-captures what is written on a whiteboard and livestreams to the course app. This would be helpful for those who are not able to make it to an in-person class and helps those who many have poor eyesight who are in-person.
5. A feature that pre-plans when assignments/projects will be due based on the course schedule/outline, so students can more easily estimate upcoming workloads before they are officially added as submittable assignments.
